A collection of simple introductory mini exercises to get familiar with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL data entry practices using the XAMPP local web server for development testing.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **HTML Calculator**: Basic calculator built with HTML.
- **JS Element Manipulation**: Exercises demonstrating DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- **PHP - MySQL Data Management**: Scripts showcasing data entry and retrieval using PHP and MySQL.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Many exercises are similar at their core but each one targets a specific aspect of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, or MySQL that helped me reinforce core concepts and gradually build confidence through variation and practice.
